# Learn Everything!
This is a project based on Obsidian + Digital Garden + Vercel

This project is centered around the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, utilizing Vercel for deployment.

~~You can visit this [website](https://learn-for-everything.vercel.app/) to see the results of the construction (~~requires a VPN, but I believe those who can access GitHub should be able to visit smoothly~~)~~ 

You can visit this [website](https://www.unlinearity.top) to see the results of the construction! 

## I. Core Philosophy
>***Have you often heard phrases like: Calculus is very useful/Linear algebra will be helpful in your future studies/Quantum mechanics/Electromagnetism/Electrical machines/Algorithms... and so on?***

>***Or often wondered: What exactly is the use of studying xx course in my future studies and life? What is the significance of learning this knowledge?***

In the process of our growth and continuous learning, we are exposed to many profound concepts, have many flashes of insight, and marvel at the thoughts and theories of many predecessors.

However, there are so many concepts that we may be amazed for a moment, influenced for a long time, but ultimately forgotten by individuals.
***
This is the significance of this repository!

The project aims to build a knowledge base with **bidirectional linking** and **relationship mapping** as its core.

It emphasizes the connections between knowledge and knowledge, focusing on the foundation of mathematics and physics, and delving into the role and impact of mathematical and physical knowledge in various fields.

- The main files are in Markdown (i.e., .md files)
- Mathematical formulas are rendered using LaTeX syntax
- Relationships between notes are presented using simple Wiki syntax

The long-term three-step plan for this project:
1. Initially build connections between basic knowledge and general knowledge
2. Connect basic knowledge with specialized professional knowledge
3. Connect all prerequisite knowledge with actual life and work

## II. Website Content
### The website currently **covers** and **continuously updates** the following content!!!!
- [x] Automatic Control Theory
- [x] Electrical Machines and Power Drag
- [x] Mathematics
  - [x] Calculus
  - [x] Probability Theory
  - [x] Mathematical Statistics
  - [x] Complex Function Theory
  - [x] Integral Transforms  
- [x] Physics
  - [x] Electromagnetism
- [x] Computer Science
  - [x] Programming Languages
    - [x] Matlab
  - [x] Machine Learning

### Potential content to add?
- [x] Philosophy
- [ ] Biology
  - [ ] Ecology
- [ ] Law
- [ ] Medicine

## III. Participating in the Construction of the Website
- If you find any errors or issues on the website
- If you think the relationships between notes are too chaotic, or the forward and backward links are not reasonable enough
- If you think the website's functionality is not comprehensive enough
- If you want to contribute a new branch
- ...

### 1. Modifying existing knowledge on the website
The original Markdown files for the notes are in the src/site/notes directory of this repository, and can be viewed at any time.

### 2. Contributing new knowledge branches
You can add your own folder in the **Contributions** section of this website to increase your own branch!

The specific contribution steps can be viewed in the [readme file](https://github.com/UNLINEARITY/Learn-for-Everything/tree/main/Contributions) in that folder.

**Believe me, it's very simple!** ~~But doing a good job may be a bit difficult, as you need to ensure the overall quality of the website~~

### 3. Adjusting the website's functionality and architecture
If you think the website should have some new features and are capable of improving it, you can make adjustments to the website at any time.
For example, what features might be implemented?
Already Implemented:
- [x] Liking and commenting on articles
Not Yet Implemented:
- [ ] Language switching between Chinese and English?
- [ ] Dark mode?

## IV. Current Issues with the Website
- Since the builder of this project is not from a computer science background, there is a lack of knowledge in website construction, and many features that websites typically have have not been implemented.
- The server is deployed on Vercel, which is not smoothly accessible in China, and due to the limitations of the free version of deployment, the number of file uploads per day is limited.
- Since the initial construction and maintenance were mainly carried out by one person, and the workload was large, the content presented is not comprehensive enough.
